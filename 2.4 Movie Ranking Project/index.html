<h1>The Best animes according to Naved</h1>
<h2>The top 3 Animes of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Dragon Ball Series</h3>
<p>It is pesrsonally my best and why not as it is where it all started for the world of anime and not to forget the insane power ups.</p>
<h3>Naruto</h3>
<p>The best story line, the best villain story, the best character development in short the best.</p>
<h3>The 7 Deadly sins</h3>
<p>Again great story and character development with insane powerups and twists.</p>
